The files together comprise the analysis for "Stronger El Ni√±os reduce tropical forest arthropod diversity and function" by Sharp, Boyle, Bonebrake, Guo, Kitching, Stork, Zeng & Ashton.

The analysis code has been developed and fully tested in R version 4.3.1 installed on a MacBook Pro M2 with 32GB memory and running macOS Sonoma 14.5. Beyond installation of R and required R packages (cowplot 1.1.3, ggplot2 3.5.1, ggtext 0.1.2, gratia 0.9.2, MASS 7.3-60, mgcv 1.9-1, vegan 2.6-8 and wCorr 1.9.8, with dependencies), this analysis should not require non-standard software or hardware.
